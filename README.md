‚úÖ Summary of the Code
This HTML + JavaScript code creates a simple calculator form that:

Takes two numbers as input (B1 and B2).

Lets the user choose an operation (Addition or Subtraction) using two radio buttons.

Displays the result in a third textbox (B3) when the "read" button is clicked.

Contains a confirm() function (not hooked up) that would default-select the Addition radio button.

However, the code:

Lacks validation for empty or invalid input.

Doesn‚Äôt handle the case where no radio button is selected.

Has an unused line and an unused button (confirm button does nothing).

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript web page that allows users to select books using checkboxes and displays the total amount of selected books when a button is clicked.

Key Components:
Checkboxes for Books:

Each checkbox represents a book with a name and its price as the value.

Books:

XYZ ‚Äì Rs.900

ABC ‚Äì Rs.1900

LMN ‚Äì Rs.2900

JavaScript Function ‚Äì Lib():

Triggered when the "Bill" button is clicked.

It checks which checkboxes are selected and sums up their values (prices).

The total is displayed inside a div with ID k.

Form:

Uses the name attribute (frm) to access the checkboxes in the JavaScript function.

Output Behavior:
When the user checks one or more books and clicks "Bill", the total price of selected books is shown on the page.

Summary of the Code:
This HTML document creates a simple interactive form with the following functionality:

Dropdown List for States:

A <select> element (id="statedropdown") provides a list of Indian states for the user to choose from.

It includes a default placeholder option: -- Select State --.

JavaScript Functionality:

A JavaScript function named State() is triggered whenever the dropdown selection changes (onchange="State()").

This function retrieves the selected state value from the dropdown and sets it as the value of a textbox.

Textbox to Display Selected State:

A readonly <input> element (id="selectedStateTextbox") displays the state selected from the dropdown.




--------------------------------demo3.html------------------------------------------------------

üîß Functionality
Inputs:

Two textboxes for numbers (nm and nm1)

A dropdown list (calculatedropdown) for selecting a mathematical operation

Output:

A third textbox (SelectedCalTextbox) displays the result

Button:

A "Calculate" button triggers the calculation (although it has some issues ‚Äî see notes below)

üîÅ JavaScript Function: Calculator()
Reads values from the two number inputs

Gets the selected operation from the dropdown

Performs the selected arithmetic operation:

Addition

Subtraction (spelled incorrectly as "Substraction")

Multiplication

Division (with zero check)

Displays the result in the third textbox

Validates the inputs to ensure they are numbers

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues in the Code
Form Submission Prevented?

onsubmit="Calculator" should be onsubmit="Calculator(); return false;" to prevent the form from reloading the page.

Calculate on Dropdown Change?

onchange="Calculator()" is triggered on operation change ‚Äî but user might want to press "Calculate" instead.

Division Logic Bug:

"Divide" message is unclear. It should be something like "Cannot divide by zero" and handle only when num2 is zero.

Spelling:

"Substraction" should be "Subtraction".

This HTML + JavaScript code creates a simple image banner that automatically rotates through 4 different images every 1 second.

Key Features:
HTML Structure:

A heading: <h1>Images</h1>.

A <div> with id banner containing an <img> tag with id bannerimg that initially displays image1.jpg.

JavaScript Functionality:

An array images[] holds the paths of 4 image files.

A variable cr tracks the current image index.

The rotate() function updates the src attribute of the image every second using setInterval().

The image index loops using the modulo operator so it cycles through the array repeatedly.

How it Works:
Every 1 second, the image shown inside the <img> tag changes to the next one in the list. When it reaches the last image, it starts again from the first.

üîπ Validation Logic (JavaScript):
The validationForm() function is triggered on form submission. It checks the following:

‚úÖ Name:

Must not be empty.

Must be 3 to 15 characters long.

Must only contain letters and spaces.

‚úÖ Email:

Must include an "@" symbol (basic validation only).

‚úÖ Age:

Must not be empty.

Must be a number greater than 0.

‚úÖ Gender:

One radio button must be selected.

‚úÖ Terms and Conditions:

Checkbox must be checked.

If all validations pass, an alert shows: "Form Submitted Successfully". If not, it shows the appropriate error and prevents form submission.
